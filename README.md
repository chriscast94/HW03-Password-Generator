# HW03-Password-Generator

## Description
I wanted the password generator to be able to create a simple password that can pass any password requirements (special characters, capital letters, etc.) while also being completely safe (randomized characters). I kept the layout simple and easy to follow along as this was meant to be a simple tool to use. 
Javascript is an exciting and difficult operation to use. I have no idea what specific thing I learned, but I can say that I learned how Javascript works; it's like a sentence.
